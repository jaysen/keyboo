# keyb - very silly scripting for a faster keyboard (linux & windows) 

Universal Near-Home-Row Navigation & Selection Keybindings (AHK on Windows, keyd on Linux)

---

## Why this exists

Provide simple keyboard shortcuts for navigation and text selection without using arrow keys. Inspired by Vim, but works in all apps on both Linux and Windows.

* **CapsLayer/NavMode** for arrows, selection, word/line jumps, and page/document movement.
* Slight Vim influence for keeping hands on the home row.
* Same bindings across both OSes.

---

## Windows

* **AutoHotkey v2** scripts.
* ahk
  * universal
    * default.ahk 
  * shared
    * `nav_lib.ahk` - movement
    * `text_lib.ahk` - text editing
    * `ui_lib.ahk` - modes/layers, tooltips

## Linux

* Using keyd for low-latency, system-wide remaps.
* keyd
  * default.conf 

## Multiplatform

* Planning to use [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata)
